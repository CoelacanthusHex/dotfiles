# Althrough manual says "Be aware that if you choose an algorithm that GnuPG supports but other OpenPGP implementations do not,
# then some users will not be able to use the key signatures you make, or quite possibly your entire key."
# But I see SHA512 in RFC4880, so other OpenPGP implementations should support it.
# On the other hand, there is only one OpenPGP implementation called GNUPG in practice.

# This make GPG run only in a secure memory environment.
# GPG will alert you when it is in an “insecure” environment.
# Usually when running in a not-lockable memory or a flash
# memory disk you will receive such message, but GPG will not terminate operations.
# This option causes GPG refuse to proceed in this situation.

# By  setting  --tofu-default-policy=unknown, this model can be used to implement the web of trust with TOFU's conflict detection algorithm, but without its assignment of positive trust values, which some security-conscious users don't like.

# Use this program to display photo user IDs
#
# %i is expanded to a temporary file that contains the photo.
# %I is the same as %i, but the file isn't deleted afterwards by GnuPG.
# %k is expanded to the key ID of the key.
# %K is expanded to the long OpenPGP key ID of the key.
# %t is expanded to the extension of the image (e.g. "jpg").
# %T is expanded to the MIME type of the image (e.g. "image/jpeg").
# %f is expanded to the fingerprint of the key.
# %% is %, of course.
#
# If %i or %I are not present, then the photo is supplied to the
# viewer on standard input.  If your platform supports it, standard
# input is the best way to do this as it avoids the time and effort in
# generating and then cleaning up a secure temp file.
